After Portworx is running, you can create and delete storage volumes through the Docker volume commands or the **pxctl** command line tool.

With **pxctl**, you can also inspect volumes, the volume relationships with containers, and nodes. For more on using **pxctl**, see the [CLI Reference](/control/status.html).

To view the global storage capacity, run:

```
# sudo /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl status
```

The following sample output of `pxctl status` shows that the global capacity for Docker containers is 128 GB.

```
# /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl status
